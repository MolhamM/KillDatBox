# KillDatBox
(Unity) a 2d game , but it's not like any , the game is about 2 players killing each others in unique way , every box(player) has a gun that he got to aim for his enemy and release , but also it's his way of movement since he moves from the force that the gun reacts , the player can rotate and move by each react of the gun so he must dodge the bullets from the enemy by hitting also , and here's the surprise you have a rewind bar that you can fill it with few right hits to your enemy , after filling this bar you have a special skill to rewind for the previous 3 seconds , so you can use it as dodging bullets or to do it after your enemy damage you , yea even the health regains !
